This error is caused by referencing a property or method that is not defined within the scope it is being referenced in.
This is either because it is in a scope that cannot be accessed, or you forgot to define a method.

Chances are this won't be an error that you can safely ignore, as this will likely result in something you intended
to happen either not working correctly or outright just doing nothing.

This can be fixed by defining whatever you're trying to reference within the correct scope.
