    <h1>Some of my favorite things</h1>

    <h2>Favorite Movie</h2>

    <p>
        My favorite movie is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872718/"><i>Nightcrawler</i></a>. 
        This movie is about a petty criminal who starts to make a name for himself as a 
        cameraman recording footage of accidents or crime scenes, and works his way up in the local news media hierarchy.

    <h2>Favorite Music</h2>

    <p>
        My favorite musician is a French composer by the name of <b>Maurice Ravel</b>. He is considered to have been a part 
        of the early 20th century impressionist movement, although he disliked the use of that term for his music.
        Here is his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ravel">Wikipedia page.</a>
