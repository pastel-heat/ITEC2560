    <h1 class="jumbotron">Consecutive Coin Flip Streak Checker</h1>

    <p>
        This is a program I wrote that analyzes a sample of 100 coin flips, and checks to see if there is at least
        one streak of 6 consecutive identical results (for example, 6 heads or 6 tails in a row). I would run this 
        experiment thousands of times in a row, and use the cumulative results to estimate the probability of 
        a streak of 6 appearing in 100 coin flips.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following code sample is the function I used to look for streaks of 6 within the sample of 100 flips. 
        I would iterate through a list of randomly generated heads or tails flips, and compare the current index 
        with the following one. If they matched, I would increment the streak counter, and if they differed it would reset.
        If the streak counter ever hit 6, it would return true, but if the program checked the whole list without a 6 streak 
        it would return false.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            # checks for a streak of 6 in the list of 100 flips, and returns True if it finds one.
            def streak_checker(coin_flips):
            # initialize streak at 1 - since if you flip a coin, no matter the result, you have a streak of 1.
                streak = 1

                # stop iteration on index 98 of list to avoid error of overstepping list bounds
                for flip in range(len(coin_flips) - 2):

                    # compare current flip with next flip, if they are the same, increase streak counter by 1
                    if coin_flips[flip] == coin_flips[flip + 1]:
                        streak += 1

                    # if not the same, reset streak counter back to 1
                    else:
                        streak = 1
        </code>
